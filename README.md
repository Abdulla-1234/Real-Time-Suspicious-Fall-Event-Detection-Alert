# Real-Time Suspicious Fall Event Detection and Alert System

An AI-powered fall detection system that combines computer vision, deep learning, and facial recognition to provide real-time monitoring and emergency alerts for elderly care and healthcare facilities.

## Overview

This system automatically detects fall incidents using video analysis, identifies the person involved through facial recognition, and sends immediate SMS alerts to emergency contacts. It's designed for homes, eldercare centers, and healthcare institutions to enhance safety monitoring.

## Two Main Points:

1) **Intelligent Fall Detection with Dual Classification:** The system uses YOLOv8 object detection combined with Farneback optical flow analysis to detect falls in real-time. It employs a dual-threshold approach to classify incidents as "Normal Fall" or "Suspicious Fall" based on confidence scores (>0.85) and motion dynamics, significantly reducing false positives while ensuring high accuracy.

2) **Personalized Emergency Response System:** Upon detecting a fall, the system uses DeepFace facial recognition to identify the individual (cosine similarity >0.7) and automatically sends personalized SMS alerts via Twilio API to registered emergency contacts. This creates a complete end-to-end solution from detection to immediate caregiver notification.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Fall Detection**: Uses YOLOv8 for accurate posture-based fall detection
- **Motion Analysis**: Farneback optical flow to detect sudden movement patterns
- **Dual Classification**: Differentiates between "Normal" and "Suspicious" falls
- **Facial Recognition**: DeepFace integration for person identification
- **Automated Alerts**: SMS notifications via Twilio API
- **User-friendly Interface**: Streamlit-based web application
- **Profile Management**: Secure registration and management system

## Technology Stack

- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, YOLOv8
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, DeepFace
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit
- **Communication**: Twilio API
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, Pandas
- **Image Processing**: PIL, scikit-image

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Webcam or video files for testing
- Twilio account for SMS functionality
- Sufficient computational resources for real-time processing

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Real-Time-Suspicious-Fall-Event-Detection-Alert.git
   cd Real-Time-Suspicious-Fall-Event-Detection-Alert
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv fall_detection_env
   source fall_detection_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: fall_detection_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Twilio credentials**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your Twilio credentials:
   ```
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
   ```

## Running the Application

### Method 1: Streamlit Web Interface (Recommended)
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

### Method 2: Direct Python Execution
```bash
python main.py
```

### Method 3: Test with Sample Video
```bash
python test.py
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Start the Application**
   - Run the Streamlit app using the command above
   - Access the web interface in your browser

2. **Register Profiles**
   - Navigate to the "Profile Management" section
   - Enter personal details (name, age, emergency contact)
   - Upload or capture a photo for facial recognition
   - Save the profile

3. **Start Monitoring**
   - Select video source (webcam or upload file)
   - Click "Start Detection" to begin monitoring
   - The system will process frames and detect falls in real-time

4. **Alert System**
   - When a fall is detected, the system will:
     - Play a local sound alert
     - Identify the person using facial recognition
     - Send SMS to registered emergency contact
     - Log the incident with timestamp
